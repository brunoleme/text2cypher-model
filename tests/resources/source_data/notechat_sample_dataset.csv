"This 60-year-old male was hospitalized due to moderate ARDS from COVID-19 with symptoms of fever, dry cough, and dyspnea. We encountered several difficulties during physical therapy on the acute ward. First, any change of position or deep breathing triggered coughing attacks that induced oxygen desaturation and dyspnea. To avoid rapid deterioration and respiratory failure, we instructed and performed position changes very slowly and step-by-step. In this way, a position change to the 135° prone position () took around 30 minutes. This approach was well tolerated and increased oxygen saturation, for example, on day 5 with 6 L/min of oxygen from 93% to 97%. Second, we had to adapt the breathing exercises to avoid prolonged coughing and oxygen desaturation. Accordingly, we instructed the patient to stop every deep breath before the need to cough and to hold inspiration for better air distribution. In this manner, the patient performed the breathing exercises well and managed to increase his oxygen saturation. Third, the patient had difficulty maintaining sufficient oxygen saturation during physical activity. However, with close monitoring and frequent breaks, he managed to perform strength and walking exercises at a low level without any significant deoxygenation. Exercise progression was low on days 1 to 5, but then increased daily until hospital discharge to a rehabilitation clinic on day 10.","
Doctor: Hi, Mr. X, I'm Dr. Y. How are you feeling today?

Patient: Not too good, doctor. I've been feeling really sick lately.

Doctor: I understand. Can you tell me what symptoms you're experiencing?

Patient: Yes, I've been having a fever, a dry cough, and dyspnea.

Doctor: I see. You were hospitalized due to moderate ARDS from COVID-19, is that correct?

Patient: Yes, that's correct.

Doctor: During your physical therapy, we encountered some difficulties. Can you tell me more about that?

Patient: Yes, I had trouble with position changes and deep breathing. Every time I tried to change my position or take a deep breath, I would start coughing and it would make me really short of breath.

Doctor: I understand. To avoid rapid deterioration and respiratory failure, we instructed you to change positions very slowly and step-by-step, right?

Patient: Yes, that's right. It took about 30 minutes to change to the prone position.

Doctor: And I see that this approach increased your oxygen saturation, for example, on day 5 with 6 L/min of oxygen from 93% to 97%.

Patient: Yes, that's correct.

Doctor: Good. We also had to adapt your breathing exercises to avoid prolonged coughing and oxygen desaturation. Can you tell me more about that?

Patient: Yes, I was instructed to stop every deep breath before coughing and to hold my breath for better air distribution.

Doctor: I see that you performed the breathing exercises well and managed to increase your oxygen saturation.

Patient: Yes, I did my best.

Doctor: You also had difficulty maintaining sufficient oxygen saturation during physical activity, is that correct?

Patient: Yes, I did. But with close monitoring and frequent breaks, I was able to perform low-level strength and walking exercises without any significant deoxygenation.

Doctor: I see that your exercise progression was low on days 1 to 5, but then increased daily until your hospital discharge to a rehabilitation clinic on day 10.

Patient: Yes, that's correct.

Doctor: Great. I'd like to keep monitoring your progress and see how you're doing. Can you keep me updated on any changes in your symptoms?

Patient: Yes, of course, doctor.

Doctor: Alright, let's keep in touch. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Patient: Thank you, doctor.

"A 39-year-old man was hospitalized due to an increasingly reduced general health condition, after persistent fever and dry cough for 2 weeks. The patient initially needed 4 L/min of oxygen, had a rapid and shallow breathing pattern at rest and became severely breathless during minor physical activities. In the beginning, physical therapy focused on patient education about dyspnea-relieving positions, the importance of regular mobilization, and deep-breathing exercises. However, it quickly became evident that his anxiety from fear of dying and worries about his future aggravated his dyspnea and vice versa. The patient was so dyspneic, anxious, and weak that he was barely able to walk to the toilet. To counter this vicious circle, the physical therapist actively listened to the patient, explained why he was experiencing breathlessness, and tested suitable positions to relieve his dyspnea. He seemed to benefit from the education and the relaxing breathing exercises, as seen on day 2, when his respiratory rate could be reduced from 30 breaths/min to 22 breaths/min and his oxygen saturation increased from 92% to 96% on 4 L/min oxygen after guiding him through some deep-breathing exercises. Over the next days, his dyspnea and anxiety started to alleviate and he regained his self-confidence. Therapy was progressively shifted to walking and strength training and the patient rapidly advanced to walk 350 m without a walking aid or supplemental oxygen before his discharge home.","
Doctor: Hello, I am Dr. Smith. Can you tell me what brings you to the hospital today?

Patient: Yes, I have been feeling very weak and sick for the past two weeks. I have a persistent fever and dry cough.

Doctor: I see. And how is your breathing?

Patient: It's been shallow and rapid, especially when I am at rest. And I get severely breathless even with minor physical activities.

Doctor: Okay. I understand. You were given physical therapy, right?

Patient: Yes, they focused on educating me about dyspnea-relieving positions and the importance of regular mobilization and deep-breathing exercises.

Doctor: That's good. And how did it go?

Patient: It became evident that my anxiety from fear of dying and worries about my future was making my dyspnea worse. I was so dyspneic, anxious, and weak that I could barely walk to the toilet.

Doctor: I see. But your physical therapist helped you with that, right?

Patient: Yes, they listened to me, explained why I was experiencing breathlessness, and tested suitable positions to relieve my dyspnea. I felt better after the education and relaxing breathing exercises.

Doctor: That's great to hear. Can you tell me more about the improvement?

Patient: On day 2, my respiratory rate reduced from 30 breaths/min to 22 breaths/min and my oxygen saturation increased from 92% to 96% on 4 L/min oxygen after some deep-breathing exercises.

Doctor: That's impressive. And how did it go after that?

Patient: My dyspnea and anxiety started to alleviate and I regained my self-confidence. The therapy was shifted to walking and strength training, and I was able to walk 350 m without a walking aid or supplemental oxygen before my discharge home.

Doctor: That's fantastic. You have made a great progress. I am glad to hear that.

"One week after a positive COVID-19 result this 57-year-old male was admitted to the ICU because of oxygen desaturation (70%) with worsening tachypnea and dyspnea. Physical therapy started immediately after ICU admission. We found a highly dyspneic patient with a high breathing frequency and significant symptom exacerbation from the slightest effort. With hands-on physical therapy guidance, the patient managed to achieve a 135° prone position and to perform deep-breathing exercises resulting in an increase in oxygen saturation from 88% to 96%. Intensive physical therapy and positioning was continued along with 6 to 12 L/min of oxygen therapy over the next days and intubation was avoided. The major challenges in achieving a prone position were the patient’s profoundly reduced respiratory capacity and the high risk of exacerbating his symptoms. However, standard ICU monitoring enabled safe implementation at an individually adapted pace to allow sufficient time for convalescence. After 3 days with this regime, he could be transferred to the normal ward, where physical therapists carried on his rehabilitation with walking and strength training. The patient’s severe instability remained a challenge. Nevertheless, 9 days after ICU admission, the patient was able to leave the hospital as a pedestrian.","
Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?

Patient: Not so good, doctor. I have been feeling short of breath and my chest feels tight.

Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about what happened?

Patient: Well, I tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to the ICU a week ago because of my oxygen levels.

Doctor: Yes, I have your medical records here. It says you were admitted to the ICU due to oxygen desaturation of 70%. Is that correct?

Patient: Yes, that's right.

Doctor: And you were also experiencing worsening tachypnea and dyspnea, correct?

Patient: Yes, I was having a hard time breathing and my breathing was getting faster.

Doctor: I understand. Physical therapy started immediately after your ICU admission, is that correct?

Patient: Yes, that's correct.

Doctor: When you were admitted to the ICU, you were a highly dyspneic patient with a high breathing frequency, correct?

Patient: Yes, I was.

"This 69-year-old male was admitted to the ICU after a dry cough for 2 weeks, oxygenation was poor and computer tomographic imaging showed typical COVID-19 pneumonia. Initially the patient received lung-protective ventilation and targeted sedation, but was otherwise stable. Treatment interventions included passive range of motion and positioning including passive mobilization into a side-edge position (). Over the next days, the patient deteriorated with hemodynamic instability and severe ARDS leading to intermittent prone positioning and continuous renal replacement therapy. The role of physical therapists during proning was to ensure correct joint positioning and pressure prophylaxis to prevent secondary complications such as nerve lesions, contractures, or pressure ulcers. Nevertheless, the long duration and repeated positioning resulted in a small pressure ulcer on the patient’s forehead. After tracheostomy, passive range-of-motion exercises, and passive side-edge mobilization were slowly resumed, whereby asynchronous ventilation and hemodynamic instability remained 2 major problems leading to further sedation and relaxation, thus inhibiting any active participation. After 24 days in the ICU, the patient scored 1/50 points on the Chelsea Critical Care Physical Assessment Tool (CPAx) and showed severe signs of muscle loss. The patient died soon after withdrawal of life support.","Doctor: Good morning, sir. How are you feeling today?
Patient: Not so good, doctor. I have been feeling sick for a couple of weeks now.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Well, I have been coughing a lot and it's been a dry cough. My breathing has been really difficult too.
Doctor: Okay. I understand. You were admitted to the ICU for this, right?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: And I see from your records that your oxygenation was poor.
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: Alright. We did a computer tomographic imaging and it showed typical COVID-19 pneumonia.

Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: Unfortunately, over the next few days, you deteriorated with hemodynamic instability and severe ARDS.
Patient: Oh no.
Doctor: Yes, so we had to put you into intermittent prone positioning and start continuous renal replacement therapy.
Patient: That sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, it is. Our physical therapists were there to ensure correct joint positioning and pressure prophylaxis to prevent secondary complications such as nerve lesions, contractures, or pressure ulcers.

"This 57-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with dyspnea, heavy dry cough, and fever 6 days after testing positive for COVID-19. Initially, he was able to exercise and sit in a chair with a physical therapist, but progressive respiratory failure necessitated intubation and proning. The patient had large amounts of bronchial mucus and required regular suctioning along with respiratory therapy. Secretions were assessed with pulmonary auscultation (presence of crackles) and by analyzing expiratory flow on the ventilator (sawtooth pattern). When suctioning failed to improve these clinical signs, 1 to 2 physical therapists used manual airway clearance techniques. The goal of these techniques was to sufficiently increase expiratory flow for effective airway clearance while avoiding alveolar collapse. To achieve this, manual compressions on the chest and abdomen were performed with just enough intensity to modify expiratory flow. After extubation, the patient was still unable to effectively clear his mucus due to weak cough. He continued to need intensive manual airway clearance techniques, nasal rinsing to induce cough and to help expectoration as well as upper and lower airway suctioning. To this end, the patient was treated up to 6 times per day/night. Additional physical therapist interventions included passive range of motion, assisted exercising, and mobilization. At the time of writing, the patient was still in the ICU without ventilatory support.","

"This 52-year-old male tested COVID-19 positive 4 days after the beginning of a dry cough, fever, and head and limb pain. One day later, he was hospitalized with exertional dyspnea. He was diagnosed with pneumonia that developed into moderate ARDS needing mechanical ventilation and intermittent dialysis. After extubation, oxygenation was stable with 2 to 3 L/min of oxygen. However, the patient was disoriented and could not communicate verbally. His global weakness (CPAx 11/50) was accompanied by oral and pharyngeal weakness and paresthesia. Spontaneous swallowing frequency and tongue control were severely reduced, and the patient showed insufficient protection from aspiration. This was confirmed by a specialized physical therapist with the Gugging Swallowing Screen, which confirmed severe dysphagia with 2/20 points. He was treated nil by mouth and received dysphagia therapy such as intensive oral stimulation, facilitation of swallowing, and training of protection mechanisms. After initial agitation and disorientation, the patient started to communicate in single-word phrases, but dysphagia continued to be severe with massive oral and pharyngeal dry saliva residuals that compromised his paresthesia and required regular mouth care. Over the next days, the patient managed to swallow pureéd food and mildly thick fluids under supervision, although cough strength was still weak (Gugging Swallowing Screen 13/20, CPAx 30/50). Nevertheless, he continued to progress and became capable of independent food ingestion (Gugging Swallowing Screen 20/20, CPAx 39/50) before his discharge to a rehabilitation clinic 25 days after admission.","Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?

"Paramedics found this 59-year-old female with dyspnea and an oxygenation of 65% on room air and performed immediate tracheal intubation. Moderate ARDS with reduced lung compliance was diagnosed and treated with deep sedation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and prone positioning.
On day 14, a trial of sitting on the edge-of-bed (SOEB) was performed, while she was still intubated and under pressure support ventilation. SOEB required 3 physical therapists to maintain the position, but resulted in a significant increase in her level of consciousness and collaborative state. The next day, she was able to hold her head and sit for about 15 minutes with 2 therapists. Her muscle strength indicated ICU-acquired weakness, with a Medical Research Council sum-score (MRC-SS) of 40/60; still she continued with small but consistent improvements and started to participate actively in physical therapy sessions. She was encouraged to mobilize herself with exercises against gravity and was actively transferred to a chair each day with the help of 2 physical therapists. She was successfully extubated, but presented postextubation dysphagia. The physical therapy team closely monitored her for secretion management and cough stimulation and continued her physical rehabilitation. On day 19, she started to walk with a walking aid, although at this point oxygen desaturation during exercise training became evident (89% with 3 L/min of oxygen). After 25 days, she was transferred to the institution’s rehabilitation facilities, where a battery of tests indicated persistent physical function impairment (MRC-SS 52/60, physical function ICU test score17 9/12, Timed Up & Go 23 seconds, short physical performance battery 4/12).","Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?

"This 33-year-old female patient had typical COVID-19 symptoms such as high fever, dry cough, headache, and dyspnea about 1 week before ICU admission. She was intubated and proned due to rapid respiratory deterioration. For the following 6 days, her situation was unstable, and physical therapy consisted of prone positioning and prevention of secondary damage. From day 7 onwards, she started to improve rapidly and could be mobilized passively into a side-edge position. After extubation, she presented postextubation dysphagia and severe ICU-acquired weakness (MRC-SS 36/60). She also suffered from pronounced delirium and anxiety and said repeatedly that she had been abducted and that she believed she had to die. She seemed to feel threatened by us and it was difficult to calm her down. Due to the pandemic measures of the Swiss government, hospital visits were not generally allowed, but because her anxiety was limiting her rehabilitation, her husband was granted an exceptional permission to visit her. This seemed to give the patient a short sense of security, and she started to participate in some basic functional activities (CPAx 21/50). Nevertheless, the delirium did not resolve upon her transfer to a peripheral acute hospital.","Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?

"This 66-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital due to an ischemic left-hemispheric stroke in addition to a dry cough and fever. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 the following day but continued to deteriorate resulting in severe ARDS, intubation, and ICU admission. Despite repeated proning, gas exchange did not improve sufficiently and the patient was placed on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 7 days. After sedation was stopped, the patient continued to be somnolent and unable to communicate or to follow commands. Physical therapy therefore focused on perception training, movement exercises, airway-clearing techniques, dysphagia therapy, and mobilization. A first SOEB trial had to be discontinued due to hemodynamic instability. Instead, the patient was positioned in a side-edge position (), which he tolerated better and where an intensive exercise training including trunk and head control was conducted. Nevertheless, muscle tone and strength remained severely reduced, particularly on his hemiplegic side, and a second SOEB trial failed again. Physical therapy was also limited because of reduced self-activity and suspected impaired perception and visual acuity. Consequently, occupational therapy was involved to create a basis of communication, to support functional initiation of upper limb movements, and to integrate perception-training into activities of daily living. Currently, the patient tolerates spontaneous breathing trials, shows signs of being alert during therapy, but cannot communicate. He is hemodynamically stable, even in an SOEB position, but remains functionally dependent (CPAx 6/50).","Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?

"A 66-year-old male started to present symptoms of fever, dyspnea, coughing, asthenia, lack of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. He was admitted to the acute care unit for observation and oxygen therapy, but his oxygen requirements constantly increased due to moderate ARDS. After 12 days of deep sedation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and proning with daily passive range of motion, the patient finally started to initiate active movements and was passively transferred to a chair. However, due to a persisting difficult weaning status, probably related to respiratory muscle weakness, tracheostomy was performed [ventilator settings: pressure support 10 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 8 cmH2O]. Subsequently, the patient showed significant improvement in his physical functions with active SOEB, chair-transfer with the help of 2 physical therapists, and active in-bed cycling against resistance for 20 minutes (). The strategy was to increase pressure support (by 5 cmH2O) during efforts to reinforce exercise training effects, unloading respiratory muscles. This strategy along with a highly collaborative patient culminated in his rapid improvement in physical function (MRC-SS 58/60, physical function ICU test score 10/12, walking distance 10 m), although he was still experiencing fatigue, inspiratory muscle weakness (maximal inspiratory pressure of −45 cmH2O) and dysphagia upon his transfer to a step-down unit.","
Doctor: Good morning, sir. I am Dr. Smith. How are you feeling today?

Patient: Not so good, doctor. I have been feeling weak and tired for a while now.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about your symptoms?

Patient: Yes, I have been having a fever, difficulty breathing, coughing, lack of energy, lack of appetite, nausea, and vomiting.

Doctor: Hmm, I see. You were admitted to the acute care unit for observation and oxygen therapy, is that correct?

Patient: Yes, that's right.

Doctor: And I see that your oxygen requirements have increased due to moderate ARDS.

Patient: Yes, that's correct.

Doctor: After 12 days of deep sedation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and proning with daily passive range of motion, you started to initiate active movements.

Patient: Yes, that's right.

Doctor: But due to a difficult weaning status, probably related to respiratory muscle weakness, tracheostomy was performed.

Patient: Yes, I remember that.

Doctor: The ventilator settings were pressure support 10 cmH2O and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 8 cmH2O, correct?

Patient: Yes, that's correct.

Doctor: And I see that you showed significant improvement in your physical functions with active SOEB, chair-transfer with the help of 2 physical therapists, and active in-bed cycling against resistance for 20 minutes.

Patient: Yes, I feel much better now.

Doctor: That's great to hear! The strategy was to increase pressure support (by 5 cmH2O) during efforts to reinforce exercise training effects, unloading respiratory muscles.

Patient: Yes, I remember that.

Doctor: This strategy along with a highly collaborative patient culminated in your rapid improvement in physical function.

Patient: Yes, I am very grateful.

Doctor: Your MRC-SS score is 58/60, and your physical function ICU test score is 10/12.

Patient: Yes, that's correct.

Doctor: And your walking distance is 10 meters.

Patient: Yes, I can walk a little bit now.

Doctor: Although you are still experiencing fatigue, inspiratory muscle weakness (maximal inspiratory pressure of −45 cmH2O) and dysphagia, you have made great progress.

Patient: Yes, I am very grateful for the care I have received.

Doctor: You are doing well, and I will continue to monitor your progress. Please let me know if you have any concerns.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. "
"This 77-year-old male patient was transferred to our ICU 1 week after his COVID-19 diagnosis due to continuing respiratory decompensation requiring intubation. Following the acute phase, with intermittent proning, the patient continued to be hemodynamically unstable and was difficult to wean. Rehabilitation proved challenging under these conditions, and physical therapists had to reevaluate and adapt their interventions daily according to his condition. After 2 weeks, he was tracheotomized and started to improve very slowly. One week after tracheostomy, the patient was able to speak for the first time after a cuff-down trial and with the help of a speaking valve. But the patient spoke only a few words with us and it was often difficult to involve him in exercises. Two days later, he was able to communicate with his relatives via video telephony. This was a very emotional moment for everyone involved, but it improved his communication and he was able to express to his wife that he had no strength left to continue. However, through the family’s active participation in his early rehabilitation process, they were able to reinforce his confidence and motivation. He was discharged to a rehabilitation clinic severely weak (MRC-SS 40/60) and functionally impaired (CPAx 22/50), but continued to progress in slow steps.","

She had a history of restrictive AN, binge-purge behaviour, and an old traumatic brain injury, leaving her with memory problems. She was well known to mental health services, having been admitted multiple times to eating disorder centres for nasogastric feeding. She had never smoked in her life and denied any alcohol intake. The patient was on ferrous fumarate, fexofenadine, fluoxetine, ibuprofen, lansoprazole, quetiapine, supplemental vitamins, regular morphine (modified release), and gabapentin.
On admission, her blood pressure was 106/85 mmHg, respiratory rate was 20 breaths/minute, heart rate was 64 beats/minute, temperature was 35.1 °C, and capillary blood glucose was 6 mmol/L. Her weight on admission was 37.3 kg (body mass index [BMI] = 12.6). On examination, she was clearly malnourished, cachexic, and dehydrated. The rest of the clinical examination was normal, as shown in Table . Her chest radiograph showed patchy consolidations in the right middle and lower lobes (Figure ). She was prescribed appropriate antibiotics. She was refusing treatment and was deemed to lack the capacity to make that decision. Therefore, Section 5(2) under the Mental Health Act was put in place. She was commenced on oral supplements as per guidance from the dietitian, and then switched to nasogastric feeding.

"A 29-year-old male was brought to the hospital by ambulance after collapsing at home. He was found to be bradycardic and hypoglycaemic with a capillary blood glucose level of 2.3 mmol/L. He had a history of eating and anxiety disorders and was not on any regular medications. On admission, his weight was 37.3 kg (BMI = 11.6). His blood pressure was initially un-recordable but subsequently was recorded to be 104/72 mmHg. His capillary blood glucose level was 4.7 mmol/L, and his Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15/15. On examination, he was noted to be severely malnourished and cachexic. The rest of the clinical examination was normal. LFTs were very abnormal, as shown in Table .
Since admission, he seemed to lack insight. Due to problems keeping him compliant with medication and intravenous glucose, he had a number of hypoglycaemic events in the first two days of admission. The following day, he was deemed not to have the capacity. He underwent Mental Capacity Assessment and Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards. He was ultimately placed under Mental Health Act 5(2) and was started on nasogastric feeding. His liver enzymes worsened further after the introduction of nasogastric feeding, but we were reassured by a normal non-invasive liver screen and ultrasound.
His condition, liver tests, and liver synthetic function improved over the course of his 24-day admission (Table ), but his stay was associated with difficult behaviour. He was eventually discharged to an Eating Disorders Unit.","
Doctor: Good morning, what brings you to the hospital today?

Patient: I was brought here by ambulance after collapsing at home.

Doctor: I see. And were you feeling okay before collapsing?

Patient: I was feeling weak and dizzy.

"A 36-year-old G4P2 premenopausal woman with a family history of colorectal, hepatobiliary cancers felt an abnormal right breast lump. Diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound showed a hypoechoic lesion in the upper outer quadrant of right breast measuring 14 mm x 13 mm x 18 mm and 5 x 4 mm satellite lesion is noted 6 mm inferior to the dominant mass, BI-RADS 5 highly suggestive of malignancy. Due to concern for multifocal disease, MRI breast with without contrast was done and it showed 2.3 x 1.1 x 2.7 cm irregular-shaped, heterogeneous mass with irregular margins in the upper outer quadrant of right breast, 7 cm from the nipple, 1.2 cm from the skin and there was an additional mass measuring 8 mm x 4 mm x 1.6 cm at 12:00 along with 4 mm lesion, 7 mm from the nipple at 10:00 (Figures (a) and (b)). Right breast biopsy from the dominant lesion showed invasive mammary carcinoma with features of both lobular and ductal carcinoma, Nottingham histological grade 2, estrogen receptor 90%, progesterone receptor 100%, HER2 2+ by IHC but negative by FISH, Ki-67 50%.
Status post right breast simple mastectomy and axillary lymph node evaluation. Surgical pathology showed a multifocal invasive mammary carcinoma of the breast with ductal and lobular features, size of largest invasive carcinoma was 55 mm, size of additional invasive foci was 1.5 mm, Nottingham histological grade 2 of 3, low to intermediate nuclear grade DCIS without central necrosis measuring at least 6 mm, margins uninvolved, one benign sentinel lymph node. Pathological staging (m)pT3 (sn)N0. Oncotype DX breast recurrence score of 16 (for patients <50 years of age, benefit from chemotherapy 1.6%). Genetic testing did not reveal any clinically significant mutations. The patient has received adjuvant PMRT 5000 cGy dose, 25 fractions along with 1000 cGy scar boost. Based on TE","Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?

Patient: I'm okay, doctor.

Doctor: That's good to hear. I understand you have some concerns about a lump in your right breast. Can you tell me more about that?

Patient: Yes, I felt an abnormal lump in my right breast a few weeks ago.

Doctor: I see. When did you first notice the lump?

Patient: I noticed it about two weeks ago.

Doctor: Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms, such as pain or discharge from your nipple?

Patient: No, I haven't noticed any pain or discharge.

Doctor: Alright. Well, I have your diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound results here. They showed a hypoechoic lesion in the upper outer quadrant of your right breast measuring 14 mm x 13 mm x 18 mm and a 5 x 4 mm satellite lesion 6 mm inferior to the dominant mass. This is highly suggestive of malignancy, or cancer.

Patient: Hmm, okay.

Doctor: Because of this, we also did an MRI of your breast without contrast, and it showed two masses. One is 2.3 x 1.1 x 2.7 cm and the other is 8 mm x 4 mm x 1.6 cm.

Patient: Oh, that's not good.

Doctor: No, it's not. But don't worry, we can treat it. Your biopsy results showed that you have invasive mammary carcinoma with features of both lobular and ductal carcinoma.

Patient: What does that mean?

Doctor: It means that you have breast cancer, but it's a type that is both lobular and ductal. The cancer cells are growing in both the milk-producing glands and the ducts that carry milk to the nipple.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: The good news is that your cancer is estrogen receptor positive, which means that it is responsive to certain hormone therapies. And your progesterone receptor is also positive.

Patient: That's good, right?

Doctor: Yes, it is. And your HER2 status is 2+, which is good news as well.

Patient: What does that mean?

Doctor: HER2 is a protein that helps some types of breast cancer grow. A positive result means that you have higher levels of the protein, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. It just means that we need to be extra careful in treating your cancer.

Patient: I see.

Doctor: You underwent a simple mastectomy and axillary lymph node evaluation, and the surgical pathology showed that you have a multifocal invasive mammary carcinoma of the breast. The largest invasive carcinoma was 55 mm, and there were also smaller invasive foci.

Patient: What does that mean?

Doctor: It means that you have multiple areas of cancer in your breast, but they are all small. Your cancer is also low to intermediate nuclear grade, which is good, and you have DCIS without central necrosis.

Patient: What's DCIS?

Doctor: DCIS stands for ductal carcinoma in situ, which means that the cancer cells are only in the ducts and have not spread to other parts of the breast.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: You also received adjuvant PMRT, which is a type of radiation therapy, with 5000 cGy dose, 25 fractions, and a 1000 cGy scar boost.

Patient: What does that mean?

Doctor: It means that you received a high dose of radiation to your breast to help kill any remaining cancer cells.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: Your Oncotype DX breast recurrence score is 16, which means that you have a low risk of the cancer coming back. And your genetic testing did not reveal any clinically significant mutations.

Patient: That's good, right?

Doctor: Yes, it is. You're doing very well, and I'm confident that you will continue to do so.

"The patient was a 62-year-old male with a past medical history of liver cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C, tobacco use, and post-stent coronary artery disease, who initially came to the hospital for elective left and right heart catheterization as a pre-transplant evaluation. Physical examination showed abdominal distension and diffuse tenderness with the presence of prominent superficial abdominal veins. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen with contrast was obtained immediately. The CT showed an occlusive thrombus of the IVC extending from the renal veins to the level of the cavoatrial junction. Thrombus was also observed in the portal vein, and multiple subcutaneous varicosities were found. Initially, a plan was made to start the patient on anticoagulation, but because of the patient’s history of advanced cirrhosis, large esophageal varices on recent endoscopy, and thrombocytopenia, we concluded that the patient was not a candidate for anticoagulation. Given that the patient had significant abdominal distention with pain that did not improve even after therapeutic paracentesis; we inserted a stent in the IVC to relieve the patient’s pain as a palliative procedure to improve his quality of life.
Right internal jugular (IJ) and right femoral vein accesses were obtained for the procedure. A 6F pigtail diagnostic catheter was advanced from the right IJ to the right atrium, and contrast was injected into the right atrium that showed an occluded IVC at the junction of the right atrium. Another pigtail catheter was advanced through the right femoral vein and an inferior venogram was performed that showed the IVC was 100% occluded 2 cm above the renal veins (Figures , ).

"We describe the case of a 55-year-old male who presented to the emergency department via emergency medical services for the chief complaint of sudden onset shortness of breath that woke him from his sleep just prior to arrival. He reported three days of non-radiating lumbar back pain and two episodes of non-bloody emesis leading up to this event. His medical history included hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His current medications were metformin, amlodipine, losartan, and atenolol. Initial vital signs revealed heart rate (HR) 75, respiratory rate (RR) 29, blood pressure (BP) 119/62, and oxygen saturation 99% on 2L nasal cannula. Temperature was 36.3°C.
Physical examination was significant for an ill-appearing male patient who was anxious and tachypneic. He also had significant work of breathing with retractions and abdominal breathing. Lungs were clear to auscultation, with no wheezing, rhonchi, or rales. Abdominal exam revealed mild epigastric tenderness with no rebound, guarding, or palpable pulsatile mass. No costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness or midline tenderness was elicited. Neurological exam revealed no focal deficits.
Due to his presentation and multiple comorbidities we had significant concern for the possible acute coronary syndrome, dissection, sepsis, or pulmonary embolism. Blood work including complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), lactic acid, troponin, urine analysis (UA) was ordered. CT-angiogram of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis was also ordered.
Complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 20.4 x 103/uL, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 376 x 103/uL. Comprehensive metabolic panel was significant for a sodium of 145 mmol/L, potassium 6.1 mmol/L, chloride 100 mmol/l, bicarbonate <7 mmol, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 67","

Doctor: Alright. Let me check your vital signs. Your heart rate is 75, respiratory rate is 29, blood pressure is 119/62, and oxygen saturation is 99% on 2L nasal cannula. Your temperature is 36.3°C.

Patient: Hmm, okay.

Doctor: During the physical examination, you appeared ill and anxious, and you were tachypneic. You also had significant work of breathing with retractions and abdominal breathing. Your lungs were clear to auscultation, with no wheezing, rhonchi, or rales. Is that correct?

Patient: Yes, that's correct.

Doctor: Alright. And during the abdominal exam, there was mild epigastric tenderness with no rebound, guarding, or palpable pulsatile mass. And there was no costovertebral angle tenderness or midline tenderness elicited. Is that correct?

Patient: Yes, that's right.

Doctor: Alright. And during the neurological exam, there were no focal deficits.

Patient: Yes, that's correct.

Doctor: Due to your presentation and multiple comorbidities, we have significant concern for the possible acute coronary syndrome, dissection, sepsis, or pulmonary embolism. That's why we ordered some blood work including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, lactic acid, troponin, and urine analysis. And we also ordered a CT-angiogram of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

Patient: Okay, I understand.

Doctor: The complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 20.4 x 103/uL, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 376 x 103/uL. The comprehensive metabolic panel was significant for a sodium of 145 mmol/L, potassium 6.1 mmol/L, chloride 100 mmol/l, bicarbonate <7 mmol, and blood urea nitrogen 67.

Patient: Hmm, okay.

Doctor: Based on these results, I would like to admit you for further evaluation and treatment. I will keep you informed of any updates.

Patient: Alright.

Doctor: And I would like to see you again in a week for a follow-up appointment.

Patient: Okay, I'll be there.

"A 58-year-old Caucasian (American) male with an unremarkable past medical history presented for evaluation of nausea, vomiting, and a 30-pound weight loss over the past two months at our hospital. He also reported dark-colored urine and intermittent episodes of hemoptysis during the same period. Specifically, he stated that his symptoms started four days after receiving his second dose of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine for COVID-19. His first dose taken three weeks earlier was well tolerated. He denied any flank or abdominal pain, melena, fever, cough, hematuria, urinary frequency or urgency, and trauma. He denied smoking. Vital signs were stable upon admission. Physical examination was insignificant for any lower extremity pitting edema, petechiae, or rash. The patient was not on any medication prior to his hospitalization.
Laboratory analysis was remarkable for serum creatinine of 4.1 mg/dL (0.8-1.4 mg/dL) along with hematuria and sub-nephrotic proteinuria of 1796 g/24 hours (<150 mg/24 hours). Our differential diagnosis at this point was wide including all nephritic syndromes given AKI, hematuria and proteinuria. All serological workup was subsequently sent. C-ANCA (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) were elevated 160 AU/mL (20-25 AU/mL) and anti-proteinase 3 (anti-PR3) antibodies were also elevated >100 EU/ mL (normal <3.5 EU/mL) (Table ). Immunohistochemical staining for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was not performed. All previous routine laboratory parameters including urinalysis were within normal range.
He underwent computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest for evaluation of hemoptysis that showed a right upper lobe consolidation and moderate bilateral pleural effusion.
The renal ultrasound was unremarkable. Renal biopsy was subsequently performed and showed acute, pauci immune","Doctor: Good morning, can you tell me your name and what brings you to the hospital today?
Patient: Good morning, my name is John. I came here because I have been feeling nauseous and have lost 30 pounds over the past two months.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your symptoms? Have you been experiencing any other symptoms besides nausea and weight loss?
Patient: Yes, I have been experiencing dark-colored urine and intermittent episodes of hemoptysis.
Doctor: Hmm, that's concerning. Did you have any pain or discomfort in your abdominal or flank area?
Patient: No, I didn't have any pain or discomfort in that area.
Doctor: Okay. Have you been experiencing any fever, cough, melena, hematuria, or urinary frequency or urgency?
Patient: No, I haven't experienced any of those symptoms.
Doctor: Alright. Can you tell me if you have had any trauma recently?
Patient: No, I haven't had any trauma.
Doctor: That's good. Can you tell me about your past medical history?
Patient: My past medical history is unremarkable.
Doctor: Alright. Can you tell me about the vaccine you received?
Patient: I received the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine for COVID-19. My first dose was three weeks ago and I had no problems. But my symptoms started four days after receiving my second dose.
Doctor: I see. When you came to the hospital, what were your vital signs like?
Patient: My vital signs were stable when I was admitted.
Doctor: That's good. During the physical examination, was there anything significant found like lower extremity pitting edema, petechiae, or rash?
Patient: No, there was nothing significant found during the physical examination.
Doctor: Alright. Were you on any medication prior to your hospitalization?
Patient: No, I wasn't on any medication prior to my hospitalization.
Doctor: Okay. The laboratory analysis showed that your serum creatinine was 4.1 mg/dL, which is higher than the normal range of 0.8-1.4 mg/dL. You also had hematuria and sub-nephrotic proteinuria of 1796 g/24 hours.
Patient: Hmm, I see.
Doctor: Our differential diagnosis at this point is wide, including all nephritic syndromes given the AKI, hematuria, and proteinuria. The C-ANCA (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) were elevated at 160 AU/mL, which is higher than the normal range of 20-25 AU/mL.

"A 67-year-old Caucasian female presented to our hospital with a chief complaint of persistent bright red blood per rectum. Her medical history was significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease with three prior myocardial infarctions, recurrent cerebrovascular accidents requiring anticoagulation with warfarin, gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, and endometrial cancer status post radiation therapy. Fifteen months prior to the current presentation, the patient was noted to have a grade 1 endometrial adenoma but was not considered a good surgical candidate due to multiple comorbidities. Vaginal hysterectomy was considered but due to her long and narrow vagina, this option was deferred initially. Her only treatment option was radiation therapy and brachytherapy. She eventually underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy due to continued pelvic pain. The patient denied any prior history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Her bleeding was described as one large episode of bright red blood per rectum associated with blood clots. She denied any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or melena. The most recent colonoscopy was performed four months ago and revealed three diminutive polyps in the transverse colon with pathology confirming tubular adenoma.
Her physical examination was significant for mild left-sided abdominal tenderness but was otherwise unremarkable. Rectal examination was notable for nonbleeding hemorrhoids and no visible blood. Blood work revealed white blood cells of 14.3k/uL (normal range 4.3-10.0 k/uL) and hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL (normal range 11.8-14.8 g/dL), which is similar to the patient’s baseline. Creatinine was slightly elevated to 1.2 and blood urea nitrogen was elevated to 39. International normalized ratio was 2.0. Due the large volume of hematochezia and presence of anemia, the patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent a colonoscopy, which revealed a large, fungating, friable, and ulcerated nonob","Doctor: Good morning, Mrs. Smith. How are you feeling today?
Patient: Good morning, doctor. I'm feeling okay, thank you.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Can you tell me what brings you to the hospital today?
Patient: Yes, I have been experiencing some bright red blood per rectum and I'm a bit worried about it.
Doctor: I understand. Can you describe the bleeding for me?
Patient: Yes, it was one large episode of bright red blood per rectum and it was accompanied by blood clots.
Doctor: Okay, I see. And have you had any other symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or melena?
Patient: No, I haven't experienced any of those symptoms.
Doctor: Alright. Can you tell me about your medical history?
Patient: Sure. I have hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and coronary artery disease with three prior myocardial infarctions. I have also had recurrent cerebrovascular accidents and I'm on anticoagulation with warfarin. I also have gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, and I was diagnosed with endometrial cancer after radiation therapy.
Doctor: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Can you tell me about your history with endometrial cancer?
Patient: Sure. I was diagnosed with grade 1 endometrial adenoma about 15 months ago, but I was not considered a good surgical candidate due to my multiple comorbidities. Vaginal hysterectomy was considered but due to my long and narrow vagina, this option was deferred initially. My only treatment option was radiation therapy and brachytherapy. I eventually underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy due to continued pelvic pain.
Doctor: I see. And have you had any prior history of gastrointestinal bleeding?
Patient: No, I haven't had any prior history of gastrointestinal bleeding.
Doctor: Alright. Your physical examination was significant for mild left-sided abdominal tenderness, but was otherwise unremarkable. Rectal examination was notable for nonbleeding hemorrhoids and no visible blood. Your blood work showed white blood cells of 14.3k/uL and hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, which is similar to your baseline. Creatinine was slightly elevated to 1.2 and blood urea nitrogen was elevated to 39. International normalized ratio was 2.0.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: Due to the large volume of hematochezia and presence of anemia, you were admitted to the hospital and underwent a colonoscopy, which revealed a large, fungating, friable, and ulcerated nonob.
Patient: What does that mean, doctor?
Doctor: It means that there is a large growth in your colon that is causing the bleeding. We will need to monitor it closely and consider further treatment options.
Patient: Okay, I understand. What do I need to do next?
Doctor: For now, we will keep you in the hospital for observation and further testing. I will also recommend a follow-up colonoscopy in six months to monitor the growth. In the meantime, it's important to maintain a healthy diet and exercise regularly to keep your overall health in check.
Patient: Alright, I will do that. Thank you, doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to ask.

"A 71-year-old African American female with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, and osteoarthritis initially presented to the emergency room with intermittent bilateral hand tingling and numbness, which was gradual in onset over months. Her symptoms were associated with seeing red spots and experiencing a burning sensation in the bottom of her feet. She was concerned because she was having difficulty picking up objects due to her hand symptoms. Her basic lab work was unremarkable, and she was provided gabapentin and magnesium oxide with close follow-up with her primary care physician. At follow-up, she complained of one to two months of unsteady gait as well as increased confusion. Her reported medications included losartan and metformin. Physical exam revealed normal pupils with reaction and accommodation (3mm diameter bilaterally), no cranial nerve deficits, normal strength throughout, and normal reflexes throughout except for diminished reflexes in the bilateral knees and ankles. She endorsed blurry vision; no ophthalmologic exam was performed, but she was able to read a name badge from one foot away. She additionally was found to have decreased vibratory and proprioception in a stocking pattern as well as a wide-based and unsteady gait.
To investigate further, tests for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), folate, B12, and rapid plasma regain (RPR) titer were ordered. Her TSH, folate, and B12 levels were within normal limits, but her RPR titer was reactive at 1:1. A subsequent reflex Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA) test was reactive. She was told to go to the hospital for further workup and treatment. Further questioning revealed that she had had two sexual partners in her life, both ex-husbands. However, she noted that her husbands committed adultery several times and that she was not currently sexually active; her last sexual encounter occurred several years ago. She endors","
