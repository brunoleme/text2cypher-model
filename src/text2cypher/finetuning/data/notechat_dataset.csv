"This 60-year-old male was hospitalized due to moderate ARDS from COVID-19 with symptoms of fever, dry cough, and dyspnea. We encountered several difficulties during physical therapy on the acute ward. First, any change of position or deep breathing triggered coughing attacks that induced oxygen desaturation and dyspnea. To avoid rapid deterioration and respiratory failure, we instructed and performed position changes very slowly and step-by-step. In this way, a position change to the 135° prone position () took around 30 minutes. This approach was well tolerated and increased oxygen saturation, for example, on day 5 with 6 L/min of oxygen from 93% to 97%. Second, we had to adapt the breathing exercises to avoid prolonged coughing and oxygen desaturation. Accordingly, we instructed the patient to stop every deep breath before the need to cough and to hold inspiration for better air distribution. In this manner, the patient performed the breathing exercises well and managed to increase his oxygen saturation. Third, the patient had difficulty maintaining sufficient oxygen saturation during physical activity. However, with close monitoring and frequent breaks, he managed to perform strength and walking exercises at a low level without any significant deoxygenation. Exercise progression was low on days 1 to 5, but then increased daily until hospital discharge to a rehabilitation clinic on day 10.","
Doctor: Hi, Mr. X, I'm Dr. Y. How are you feeling today?

Patient: Not too good, doctor. I've been feeling really sick lately.

Doctor: I understand. Can you tell me what symptoms you're experiencing?

Patient: Yes, I've been having a fever, a dry cough, and dyspnea.

Doctor: I see. You were hospitalized due to moderate ARDS from COVID-19, is that correct?

Patient: Yes, that's correct.

Doctor: During your physical therapy, we encountered some difficulties. Can you tell me more about that?

Patient: Yes, I had trouble with position changes and deep breathing. Every time I tried to change my position or take a deep breath, I would start coughing and it would make me really short of breath.

Doctor: I understand. To avoid rapid deterioration and respiratory failure, we instructed you to change positions very slowly and step-by-step, right?

Patient: Yes, that's right. It took about 30 minutes to change to the prone position.

Doctor: And I see that this approach increased your oxygen saturation, for example, on day 5 with 6 L/min of oxygen from 93% to 97%.

Patient: Yes, that's correct.

Doctor: Good. We also had to adapt your breathing exercises to avoid prolonged coughing and oxygen desaturation. Can you tell me more about that?

Patient: Yes, I was instructed to stop every deep breath before coughing and to hold my breath for better air distribution.

Doctor: I see that you performed the breathing exercises well and managed to increase your oxygen saturation.

Patient: Yes, I did my best.

Doctor: You also had difficulty maintaining sufficient oxygen saturation during physical activity, is that correct?

Patient: Yes, I did. But with close monitoring and frequent breaks, I was able to perform low-level strength and walking exercises without any significant deoxygenation.

Doctor: I see that your exercise progression was low on days 1 to 5, but then increased daily until your hospital discharge to a rehabilitation clinic on day 10.

Patient: Yes, that's correct.

Doctor: Great. I'd like to keep monitoring your progress and see how you're doing. Can you keep me updated on any changes in your symptoms?

Patient: Yes, of course, doctor.

Doctor: Alright, let's keep in touch. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Patient: Thank you, doctor.

"A 39-year-old man was hospitalized due to an increasingly reduced general health condition, after persistent fever and dry cough for 2 weeks. The patient initially needed 4 L/min of oxygen, had a rapid and shallow breathing pattern at rest and became severely breathless during minor physical activities. In the beginning, physical therapy focused on patient education about dyspnea-relieving positions, the importance of regular mobilization, and deep-breathing exercises. However, it quickly became evident that his anxiety from fear of dying and worries about his future aggravated his dyspnea and vice versa. The patient was so dyspneic, anxious, and weak that he was barely able to walk to the toilet. To counter this vicious circle, the physical therapist actively listened to the patient, explained why he was experiencing breathlessness, and tested suitable positions to relieve his dyspnea. He seemed to benefit from the education and the relaxing breathing exercises, as seen on day 2, when his respiratory rate could be reduced from 30 breaths/min to 22 breaths/min and his oxygen saturation increased from 92% to 96% on 4 L/min oxygen after guiding him through some deep-breathing exercises. Over the next days, his dyspnea and anxiety started to alleviate and he regained his self-confidence. Therapy was progressively shifted to walking and strength training and the patient rapidly advanced to walk 350 m without a walking aid or supplemental oxygen before his discharge home.","
Doctor: Hello, I am Dr. Smith. Can you tell me what brings you to the hospital today?

Patient: Yes, I have been feeling very weak and sick for the past two weeks. I have a persistent fever and dry cough.

Doctor: I see. And how is your breathing?

Patient: It's been shallow and rapid, especially when I am at rest. And I get severely breathless even with minor physical activities.

Doctor: Okay. I understand. You were given physical therapy, right?

Patient: Yes, they focused on educating me about dyspnea-relieving positions and the importance of regular mobilization and deep-breathing exercises.

Doctor: That's good. And how did it go?

Patient: It became evident that my anxiety from fear of dying and worries about my future was making my dyspnea worse. I was so dyspneic, anxious, and weak that I could barely walk to the toilet.

Doctor: I see. But your physical therapist helped you with that, right?

Patient: Yes, they listened to me, explained why I was experiencing breathlessness, and tested suitable positions to relieve my dyspnea. I felt better after the education and relaxing breathing exercises.

Doctor: That's great to hear. Can you tell me more about the improvement?

Patient: On day 2, my respiratory rate reduced from 30 breaths/min to 22 breaths/min and my oxygen saturation increased from 92% to 96% on 4 L/min oxygen after some deep-breathing exercises.

Doctor: That's impressive. And how did it go after that?

Patient: My dyspnea and anxiety started to alleviate and I regained my self-confidence. The therapy was shifted to walking and strength training, and I was able to walk 350 m without a walking aid or supplemental oxygen before my discharge home.

Doctor: That's fantastic. You have made a great progress. I am glad to hear that.

"One week after a positive COVID-19 result this 57-year-old male was admitted to the ICU because of oxygen desaturation (70%) with worsening tachypnea and dyspnea. Physical therapy started immediately after ICU admission. We found a highly dyspneic patient with a high breathing frequency and significant symptom exacerbation from the slightest effort. With hands-on physical therapy guidance, the patient managed to achieve a 135° prone position and to perform deep-breathing exercises resulting in an increase in oxygen saturation from 88% to 96%. Intensive physical therapy and positioning was continued along with 6 to 12 L/min of oxygen therapy over the next days and intubation was avoided. The major challenges in achieving a prone position were the patient’s profoundly reduced respiratory capacity and the high risk of exacerbating his symptoms. However, standard ICU monitoring enabled safe implementation at an individually adapted pace to allow sufficient time for convalescence. After 3 days with this regime, he could be transferred to the normal ward, where physical therapists carried on his rehabilitation with walking and strength training. The patient’s severe instability remained a challenge. Nevertheless, 9 days after ICU admission, the patient was able to leave the hospital as a pedestrian.","
Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?

Patient: Not so good, doctor. I have been feeling short of breath and my chest feels tight.

Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about what happened?

Patient: Well, I tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to the ICU a week ago because of my oxygen levels.

Doctor: Yes, I have your medical records here. It says you were admitted to the ICU due to oxygen desaturation of 70%. Is that correct?

Patient: Yes, that's right.

Doctor: And you were also experiencing worsening tachypnea and dyspnea, correct?

Patient: Yes, I was having a hard time breathing and my breathing was getting faster.

Doctor: I understand. Physical therapy started immediately after your ICU admission, is that correct?

Patient: Yes, that's correct.

Doctor: When you were admitted to the ICU, you were a highly dyspneic patient with a high breathing frequency, correct?

Patient: Yes, I was.

"This 69-year-old male was admitted to the ICU after a dry cough for 2 weeks, oxygenation was poor and computer tomographic imaging showed typical COVID-19 pneumonia. Initially the patient received lung-protective ventilation and targeted sedation, but was otherwise stable. Treatment interventions included passive range of motion and positioning including passive mobilization into a side-edge position (). Over the next days, the patient deteriorated with hemodynamic instability and severe ARDS leading to intermittent prone positioning and continuous renal replacement therapy. The role of physical therapists during proning was to ensure correct joint positioning and pressure prophylaxis to prevent secondary complications such as nerve lesions, contractures, or pressure ulcers. Nevertheless, the long duration and repeated positioning resulted in a small pressure ulcer on the patient’s forehead. After tracheostomy, passive range-of-motion exercises, and passive side-edge mobilization were slowly resumed, whereby asynchronous ventilation and hemodynamic instability remained 2 major problems leading to further sedation and relaxation, thus inhibiting any active participation. After 24 days in the ICU, the patient scored 1/50 points on the Chelsea Critical Care Physical Assessment Tool (CPAx) and showed severe signs of muscle loss. The patient died soon after withdrawal of life support.","Doctor: Good morning, sir. How are you feeling today?
Patient: Not so good, doctor. I have been feeling sick for a couple of weeks now.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Well, I have been coughing a lot and it's been a dry cough. My breathing has been really difficult too.
Doctor: Okay. I understand. You were admitted to the ICU for this, right?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: And I see from your records that your oxygenation was poor.
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: Alright. We did a computer tomographic imaging and it showed typical COVID-19 pneumonia.

Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: Unfortunately, over the next few days, you deteriorated with hemodynamic instability and severe ARDS.
Patient: Oh no.
Doctor: Yes, so we had to put you into intermittent prone positioning and start continuous renal replacement therapy.
Patient: That sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, it is. Our physical therapists were there to ensure correct joint positioning and pressure prophylaxis to prevent secondary complications such as nerve lesions, contractures, or pressure ulcers.

"This 57-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with dyspnea, heavy dry cough, and fever 6 days after testing positive for COVID-19. Initially, he was able to exercise and sit in a chair with a physical therapist, but progressive respiratory failure necessitated intubation and proning. The patient had large amounts of bronchial mucus and required regular suctioning along with respiratory therapy. Secretions were assessed with pulmonary auscultation (presence of crackles) and by analyzing expiratory flow on the ventilator (sawtooth pattern). When suctioning failed to improve these clinical signs, 1 to 2 physical therapists used manual airway clearance techniques. The goal of these techniques was to sufficiently increase expiratory flow for effective airway clearance while avoiding alveolar collapse. To achieve this, manual compressions on the chest and abdomen were performed with just enough intensity to modify expiratory flow. After extubation, the patient was still unable to effectively clear his mucus due to weak cough. He continued to need intensive manual airway clearance techniques, nasal rinsing to induce cough and to help expectoration as well as upper and lower airway suctioning. To this end, the patient was treated up to 6 times per day/night. Additional physical therapist interventions included passive range of motion, assisted exercising, and mobilization. At the time of writing, the patient was still in the ICU without ventilatory support.","

"This 52-year-old male tested COVID-19 positive 4 days after the beginning of a dry cough, fever, and head and limb pain. One day later, he was hospitalized with exertional dyspnea. He was diagnosed with pneumonia that developed into moderate ARDS needing mechanical ventilation and intermittent dialysis. After extubation, oxygenation was stable with 2 to 3 L/min of oxygen. However, the patient was disoriented and could not communicate verbally. His global weakness (CPAx 11/50) was accompanied by oral and pharyngeal weakness and paresthesia. Spontaneous swallowing frequency and tongue control were severely reduced, and the patient showed insufficient protection from aspiration. This was confirmed by a specialized physical therapist with the Gugging Swallowing Screen, which confirmed severe dysphagia with 2/20 points. He was treated nil by mouth and received dysphagia therapy such as intensive oral stimulation, facilitation of swallowing, and training of protection mechanisms. After initial agitation and disorientation, the patient started to communicate in single-word phrases, but dysphagia continued to be severe with massive oral and pharyngeal dry saliva residuals that compromised his paresthesia and required regular mouth care. Over the next days, the patient managed to swallow pureéd food and mildly thick fluids under supervision, although cough strength was still weak (Gugging Swallowing Screen 13/20, CPAx 30/50). Nevertheless, he continued to progress and became capable of independent food ingestion (Gugging Swallowing Screen 20/20, CPAx 39/50) before his discharge to a rehabilitation clinic 25 days after admission.","Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?

"Paramedics found this 59-year-old female with dyspnea and an oxygenation of 65% on room air and performed immediate tracheal intubation. Moderate ARDS with reduced lung compliance was diagnosed and treated with deep sedation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and prone positioning.
On day 14, a trial of sitting on the edge-of-bed (SOEB) was performed, while she was still intubated and under pressure support ventilation. SOEB required 3 physical therapists to maintain the position, but resulted in a significant increase in her level of consciousness and collaborative state. The next day, she was able to hold her head and sit for about 15 minutes with 2 therapists. Her muscle strength indicated ICU-acquired weakness, with a Medical Research Council sum-score (MRC-SS) of 40/60; still she continued with small but consistent improvements and started to participate actively in physical therapy sessions. She was encouraged to mobilize herself with exercises against gravity and was actively transferred to a chair each day with the help of 2 physical therapists. She was successfully extubated, but presented postextubation dysphagia. The physical therapy team closely monitored her for secretion management and cough stimulation and continued her physical rehabilitation. On day 19, she started to walk with a walking aid, although at this point oxygen desaturation during exercise training became evident (89% with 3 L/min of oxygen). After 25 days, she was transferred to the institution’s rehabilitation facilities, where a battery of tests indicated persistent physical function impairment (MRC-SS 52/60, physical function ICU test score17 9/12, Timed Up & Go 23 seconds, short physical performance battery 4/12).","Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?

"This 33-year-old female patient had typical COVID-19 symptoms such as high fever, dry cough, headache, and dyspnea about 1 week before ICU admission. She was intubated and proned due to rapid respiratory deterioration. For the following 6 days, her situation was unstable, and physical therapy consisted of prone positioning and prevention of secondary damage. From day 7 onwards, she started to improve rapidly and could be mobilized passively into a side-edge position. After extubation, she presented postextubation dysphagia and severe ICU-acquired weakness (MRC-SS 36/60). She also suffered from pronounced delirium and anxiety and said repeatedly that she had been abducted and that she believed she had to die. She seemed to feel threatened by us and it was difficult to calm her down. Due to the pandemic measures of the Swiss government, hospital visits were not generally allowed, but because her anxiety was limiting her rehabilitation, her husband was granted an exceptional permission to visit her. This seemed to give the patient a short sense of security, and she started to participate in some basic functional activities (CPAx 21/50). Nevertheless, the delirium did not resolve upon her transfer to a peripheral acute hospital.","Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?

"This 66-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital due to an ischemic left-hemispheric stroke in addition to a dry cough and fever. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 the following day but continued to deteriorate resulting in severe ARDS, intubation, and ICU admission. Despite repeated proning, gas exchange did not improve sufficiently and the patient was placed on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 7 days. After sedation was stopped, the patient continued to be somnolent and unable to communicate or to follow commands. Physical therapy therefore focused on perception training, movement exercises, airway-clearing techniques, dysphagia therapy, and mobilization. A first SOEB trial had to be discontinued due to hemodynamic instability. Instead, the patient was positioned in a side-edge position (), which he tolerated better and where an intensive exercise training including trunk and head control was conducted. Nevertheless, muscle tone and strength remained severely reduced, particularly on his hemiplegic side, and a second SOEB trial failed again. Physical therapy was also limited because of reduced self-activity and suspected impaired perception and visual acuity. Consequently, occupational therapy was involved to create a basis of communication, to support functional initiation of upper limb movements, and to integrate perception-training into activities of daily living. Currently, the patient tolerates spontaneous breathing trials, shows signs of being alert during therapy, but cannot communicate. He is hemodynamically stable, even in an SOEB position, but remains functionally dependent (CPAx 6/50).","Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?

"A 66-year-old male started to present symptoms of fever, dyspnea, coughing, asthenia, lack of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. He was admitted to the acute care unit for observation and oxygen therapy, but his oxygen requirements constantly increased due to moderate ARDS. After 12 days of deep sedation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and proning with daily passive range of motion, the patient finally started to initiate active movements and was passively transferred to a chair. However, due to a persisting difficult weaning status, probably related to respiratory muscle weakness, tracheostomy was performed [ventilator settings: pressure support 10 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 8 cmH2O]. Subsequently, the patient showed significant improvement in his physical functions with active SOEB, chair-transfer with the help of 2 physical therapists, and active in-bed cycling against resistance for 20 minutes (). The strategy was to increase pressure support (by 5 cmH2O) during efforts to reinforce exercise training effects, unloading respiratory muscles. This strategy along with a highly collaborative patient culminated in his rapid improvement in physical function (MRC-SS 58/60, physical function ICU test score 10/12, walking distance 10 m), although he was still experiencing fatigue, inspiratory muscle weakness (maximal inspiratory pressure of −45 cmH2O) and dysphagia upon his transfer to a step-down unit.","
Doctor: Good morning, sir. I am Dr. Smith. How are you feeling today?

Patient: Not so good, doctor. I have been feeling weak and tired for a while now.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about your symptoms?

Patient: Yes, I have been having a fever, difficulty breathing, coughing, lack of energy, lack of appetite, nausea, and vomiting.

Doctor: Hmm, I see. You were admitted to the acute care unit for observation and oxygen therapy, is that correct?

Patient: Yes, that's right.

Doctor: And I see that your oxygen requirements have increased due to moderate ARDS.

Patient: Yes, that's correct.

Doctor: After 12 days of deep sedation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and proning with daily passive range of motion, you started to initiate active movements.

Patient: Yes, that's right.

Doctor: But due to a difficult weaning status, probably related to respiratory muscle weakness, tracheostomy was performed.

Patient: Yes, I remember that.

Doctor: The ventilator settings were pressure support 10 cmH2O and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 8 cmH2O, correct?

Patient: Yes, that's correct.

Doctor: And I see that you showed significant improvement in your physical functions with active SOEB, chair-transfer with the help of 2 physical therapists, and active in-bed cycling against resistance for 20 minutes.

Patient: Yes, I feel much better now.

Doctor: That's great to hear! The strategy was to increase pressure support (by 5 cmH2O) during efforts to reinforce exercise training effects, unloading respiratory muscles.

Patient: Yes, I remember that.

Doctor: This strategy along with a highly collaborative patient culminated in your rapid improvement in physical function.

Patient: Yes, I am very grateful.

Doctor: Your MRC-SS score is 58/60, and your physical function ICU test score is 10/12.

Patient: Yes, that's correct.

Doctor: And your walking distance is 10 meters.

Patient: Yes, I can walk a little bit now.

Doctor: Although you are still experiencing fatigue, inspiratory muscle weakness (maximal inspiratory pressure of −45 cmH2O) and dysphagia, you have made great progress.

Patient: Yes, I am very grateful for the care I have received.

Doctor: You are doing well, and I will continue to monitor your progress. Please let me know if you have any concerns.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. "
"This 77-year-old male patient was transferred to our ICU 1 week after his COVID-19 diagnosis due to continuing respiratory decompensation requiring intubation. Following the acute phase, with intermittent proning, the patient continued to be hemodynamically unstable and was difficult to wean. Rehabilitation proved challenging under these conditions, and physical therapists had to reevaluate and adapt their interventions daily according to his condition. After 2 weeks, he was tracheotomized and started to improve very slowly. One week after tracheostomy, the patient was able to speak for the first time after a cuff-down trial and with the help of a speaking valve. But the patient spoke only a few words with us and it was often difficult to involve him in exercises. Two days later, he was able to communicate with his relatives via video telephony. This was a very emotional moment for everyone involved, but it improved his communication and he was able to express to his wife that he had no strength left to continue. However, through the family’s active participation in his early rehabilitation process, they were able to reinforce his confidence and motivation. He was discharged to a rehabilitation clinic severely weak (MRC-SS 40/60) and functionally impaired (CPAx 22/50), but continued to progress in slow steps.","

She had a history of restrictive AN, binge-purge behaviour, and an old traumatic brain injury, leaving her with memory problems. She was well known to mental health services, having been admitted multiple times to eating disorder centres for nasogastric feeding. She had never smoked in her life and denied any alcohol intake. The patient was on ferrous fumarate, fexofenadine, fluoxetine, ibuprofen, lansoprazole, quetiapine, supplemental vitamins, regular morphine (modified release), and gabapentin.
On admission, her blood pressure was 106/85 mmHg, respiratory rate was 20 breaths/minute, heart rate was 64 beats/minute, temperature was 35.1 °C, and capillary blood glucose was 6 mmol/L. Her weight on admission was 37.3 kg (body mass index [BMI] = 12.6). On examination, she was clearly malnourished, cachexic, and dehydrated. The rest of the clinical examination was normal, as shown in Table . Her chest radiograph showed patchy consolidations in the right middle and lower lobes (Figure ). She was prescribed appropriate antibiotics. She was refusing treatment and was deemed to lack the capacity to make that decision. Therefore, Section 5(2) under the Mental Health Act was put in place. She was commenced on oral supplements as per guidance from the dietitian, and then switched to nasogastric feeding.

"A 29-year-old male was brought to the hospital by ambulance after collapsing at home. He was found to be bradycardic and hypoglycaemic with a capillary blood glucose level of 2.3 mmol/L. He had a history of eating and anxiety disorders and was not on any regular medications. On admission, his weight was 37.3 kg (BMI = 11.6). His blood pressure was initially un-recordable but subsequently was recorded to be 104/72 mmHg. His capillary blood glucose level was 4.7 mmol/L, and his Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15/15. On examination, he was noted to be severely malnourished and cachexic. The rest of the clinical examination was normal. LFTs were very abnormal, as shown in Table .
Since admission, he seemed to lack insight. Due to problems keeping him compliant with medication and intravenous glucose, he had a number of hypoglycaemic events in the first two days of admission. The following day, he was deemed not to have the capacity. He underwent Mental Capacity Assessment and Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards. He was ultimately placed under Mental Health Act 5(2) and was started on nasogastric feeding. His liver enzymes worsened further after the introduction of nasogastric feeding, but we were reassured by a normal non-invasive liver screen and ultrasound.
His condition, liver tests, and liver synthetic function improved over the course of his 24-day admission (Table ), but his stay was associated with difficult behaviour. He was eventually discharged to an Eating Disorders Unit.","
Doctor: Good morning, what brings you to the hospital today?

Patient: I was brought here by ambulance after collapsing at home.

Doctor: I see. And were you feeling okay before collapsing?

Patient: I was feeling weak and dizzy.

"A 36-year-old G4P2 premenopausal woman with a family history of colorectal, hepatobiliary cancers felt an abnormal right breast lump. Diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound showed a hypoechoic lesion in the upper outer quadrant of right breast measuring 14 mm x 13 mm x 18 mm and 5 x 4 mm satellite lesion is noted 6 mm inferior to the dominant mass, BI-RADS 5 highly suggestive of malignancy. Due to concern for multifocal disease, MRI breast with without contrast was done and it showed 2.3 x 1.1 x 2.7 cm irregular-shaped, heterogeneous mass with irregular margins in the upper outer quadrant of right breast, 7 cm from the nipple, 1.2 cm from the skin and there was an additional mass measuring 8 mm x 4 mm x 1.6 cm at 12:00 along with 4 mm lesion, 7 mm from the nipple at 10:00 (Figures (a) and (b)). Right breast biopsy from the dominant lesion showed invasive mammary carcinoma with features of both lobular and ductal carcinoma, Nottingham histological grade 2, estrogen receptor 90%, progesterone receptor 100%, HER2 2+ by IHC but negative by FISH, Ki-67 50%.
Status post right breast simple mastectomy and axillary lymph node evaluation. Surgical pathology showed a multifocal invasive mammary carcinoma of the breast with ductal and lobular features, size of largest invasive carcinoma was 55 mm, size of additional invasive foci was 1.5 mm, Nottingham histological grade 2 of 3, low to intermediate nuclear grade DCIS without central necrosis measuring at least 6 mm, margins uninvolved, one benign sentinel lymph node. Pathological staging (m)pT3 (sn)N0. Oncotype DX breast recurrence score of 16 (for patients <50 years of age, benefit from chemotherapy 1.6%). Genetic testing did not reveal any clinically significant mutations. The patient has received adjuvant PMRT 5000 cGy dose, 25 fractions along with 1000 cGy scar boost. Based on TE","Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?

Patient: I'm okay, doctor.

Doctor: That's good to hear. I understand you have some concerns about a lump in your right breast. Can you tell me more about that?

Patient: Yes, I felt an abnormal lump in my right breast a few weeks ago.

Doctor: I see. When did you first notice the lump?

Patient: I noticed it about two weeks ago.

Doctor: Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms, such as pain or discharge from your nipple?

Patient: No, I haven't noticed any pain or discharge.

Doctor: Alright. Well, I have your diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound results here. They showed a hypoechoic lesion in the upper outer quadrant of your right breast measuring 14 mm x 13 mm x 18 mm and a 5 x 4 mm satellite lesion 6 mm inferior to the dominant mass. This is highly suggestive of malignancy, or cancer.

Patient: Hmm, okay.

Doctor: Because of this, we also did an MRI of your breast without contrast, and it showed two masses. One is 2.3 x 1.1 x 2.7 cm and the other is 8 mm x 4 mm x 1.6 cm.

Patient: Oh, that's not good.

Doctor: No, it's not. But don't worry, we can treat it. Your biopsy results showed that you have invasive mammary carcinoma with features of both lobular and ductal carcinoma.

Patient: What does that mean?

Doctor: It means that you have breast cancer, but it's a type that is both lobular and ductal. The cancer cells are growing in both the milk-producing glands and the ducts that carry milk to the nipple.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: The good news is that your cancer is estrogen receptor positive, which means that it is responsive to certain hormone therapies. And your progesterone receptor is also positive.

Patient: That's good, right?

Doctor: Yes, it is. And your HER2 status is 2+, which is good news as well.

Patient: What does that mean?

Doctor: HER2 is a protein that helps some types of breast cancer grow. A positive result means that you have higher levels of the protein, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. It just means that we need to be extra careful in treating your cancer.

Patient: I see.

Doctor: You underwent a simple mastectomy and axillary lymph node evaluation, and the surgical pathology showed that you have a multifocal invasive mammary carcinoma of the breast. The largest invasive carcinoma was 55 mm, and there were also smaller invasive foci.

Patient: What does that mean?

Doctor: It means that you have multiple areas of cancer in your breast, but they are all small. Your cancer is also low to intermediate nuclear grade, which is good, and you have DCIS without central necrosis.

Patient: What's DCIS?

Doctor: DCIS stands for ductal carcinoma in situ, which means that the cancer cells are only in the ducts and have not spread to other parts of the breast.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: You also received adjuvant PMRT, which is a type of radiation therapy, with 5000 cGy dose, 25 fractions, and a 1000 cGy scar boost.

Patient: What does that mean?

Doctor: It means that you received a high dose of radiation to your breast to help kill any remaining cancer cells.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: Your Oncotype DX breast recurrence score is 16, which means that you have a low risk of the cancer coming back. And your genetic testing did not reveal any clinically significant mutations.

Patient: That's good, right?

Doctor: Yes, it is. You're doing very well, and I'm confident that you will continue to do so.

"The patient was a 62-year-old male with a past medical history of liver cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C, tobacco use, and post-stent coronary artery disease, who initially came to the hospital for elective left and right heart catheterization as a pre-transplant evaluation. Physical examination showed abdominal distension and diffuse tenderness with the presence of prominent superficial abdominal veins. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen with contrast was obtained immediately. The CT showed an occlusive thrombus of the IVC extending from the renal veins to the level of the cavoatrial junction. Thrombus was also observed in the portal vein, and multiple subcutaneous varicosities were found. Initially, a plan was made to start the patient on anticoagulation, but because of the patient’s history of advanced cirrhosis, large esophageal varices on recent endoscopy, and thrombocytopenia, we concluded that the patient was not a candidate for anticoagulation. Given that the patient had significant abdominal distention with pain that did not improve even after therapeutic paracentesis; we inserted a stent in the IVC to relieve the patient’s pain as a palliative procedure to improve his quality of life.
Right internal jugular (IJ) and right femoral vein accesses were obtained for the procedure. A 6F pigtail diagnostic catheter was advanced from the right IJ to the right atrium, and contrast was injected into the right atrium that showed an occluded IVC at the junction of the right atrium. Another pigtail catheter was advanced through the right femoral vein and an inferior venogram was performed that showed the IVC was 100% occluded 2 cm above the renal veins (Figures , ).

"We describe the case of a 55-year-old male who presented to the emergency department via emergency medical services for the chief complaint of sudden onset shortness of breath that woke him from his sleep just prior to arrival. He reported three days of non-radiating lumbar back pain and two episodes of non-bloody emesis leading up to this event. His medical history included hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His current medications were metformin, amlodipine, losartan, and atenolol. Initial vital signs revealed heart rate (HR) 75, respiratory rate (RR) 29, blood pressure (BP) 119/62, and oxygen saturation 99% on 2L nasal cannula. Temperature was 36.3°C.
Physical examination was significant for an ill-appearing male patient who was anxious and tachypneic. He also had significant work of breathing with retractions and abdominal breathing. Lungs were clear to auscultation, with no wheezing, rhonchi, or rales. Abdominal exam revealed mild epigastric tenderness with no rebound, guarding, or palpable pulsatile mass. No costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness or midline tenderness was elicited. Neurological exam revealed no focal deficits.
Due to his presentation and multiple comorbidities we had significant concern for the possible acute coronary syndrome, dissection, sepsis, or pulmonary embolism. Blood work including complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), lactic acid, troponin, urine analysis (UA) was ordered. CT-angiogram of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis was also ordered.
Complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 20.4 x 103/uL, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 376 x 103/uL. Comprehensive metabolic panel was significant for a sodium of 145 mmol/L, potassium 6.1 mmol/L, chloride 100 mmol/l, bicarbonate <7 mmol, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 67","

Doctor: Alright. Let me check your vital signs. Your heart rate is 75, respiratory rate is 29, blood pressure is 119/62, and oxygen saturation is 99% on 2L nasal cannula. Your temperature is 36.3°C.

Patient: Hmm, okay.

Doctor: During the physical examination, you appeared ill and anxious, and you were tachypneic. You also had significant work of breathing with retractions and abdominal breathing. Your lungs were clear to auscultation, with no wheezing, rhonchi, or rales. Is that correct?

Patient: Yes, that's correct.

Doctor: Alright. And during the abdominal exam, there was mild epigastric tenderness with no rebound, guarding, or palpable pulsatile mass. And there was no costovertebral angle tenderness or midline tenderness elicited. Is that correct?

Patient: Yes, that's right.

Doctor: Alright. And during the neurological exam, there were no focal deficits.

Patient: Yes, that's correct.

Doctor: Due to your presentation and multiple comorbidities, we have significant concern for the possible acute coronary syndrome, dissection, sepsis, or pulmonary embolism. That's why we ordered some blood work including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, lactic acid, troponin, and urine analysis. And we also ordered a CT-angiogram of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

Patient: Okay, I understand.

Doctor: The complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 20.4 x 103/uL, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 376 x 103/uL. The comprehensive metabolic panel was significant for a sodium of 145 mmol/L, potassium 6.1 mmol/L, chloride 100 mmol/l, bicarbonate <7 mmol, and blood urea nitrogen 67.

Patient: Hmm, okay.

Doctor: Based on these results, I would like to admit you for further evaluation and treatment. I will keep you informed of any updates.

Patient: Alright.

Doctor: And I would like to see you again in a week for a follow-up appointment.

Patient: Okay, I'll be there.

"A 58-year-old Caucasian (American) male with an unremarkable past medical history presented for evaluation of nausea, vomiting, and a 30-pound weight loss over the past two months at our hospital. He also reported dark-colored urine and intermittent episodes of hemoptysis during the same period. Specifically, he stated that his symptoms started four days after receiving his second dose of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine for COVID-19. His first dose taken three weeks earlier was well tolerated. He denied any flank or abdominal pain, melena, fever, cough, hematuria, urinary frequency or urgency, and trauma. He denied smoking. Vital signs were stable upon admission. Physical examination was insignificant for any lower extremity pitting edema, petechiae, or rash. The patient was not on any medication prior to his hospitalization.
Laboratory analysis was remarkable for serum creatinine of 4.1 mg/dL (0.8-1.4 mg/dL) along with hematuria and sub-nephrotic proteinuria of 1796 g/24 hours (<150 mg/24 hours). Our differential diagnosis at this point was wide including all nephritic syndromes given AKI, hematuria and proteinuria. All serological workup was subsequently sent. C-ANCA (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) were elevated 160 AU/mL (20-25 AU/mL) and anti-proteinase 3 (anti-PR3) antibodies were also elevated >100 EU/ mL (normal <3.5 EU/mL) (Table ). Immunohistochemical staining for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was not performed. All previous routine laboratory parameters including urinalysis were within normal range.
He underwent computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest for evaluation of hemoptysis that showed a right upper lobe consolidation and moderate bilateral pleural effusion.
The renal ultrasound was unremarkable. Renal biopsy was subsequently performed and showed acute, pauci immune","Doctor: Good morning, can you tell me your name and what brings you to the hospital today?

"A 67-year-old Caucasian female presented to our hospital with a chief complaint of persistent bright red blood per rectum. Her medical history was significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease with three prior myocardial infarctions, recurrent cerebrovascular accidents requiring anticoagulation with warfarin, gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, and endometrial cancer status post radiation therapy. Fifteen months prior to the current presentation, the patient was noted to have a grade 1 endometrial adenoma but was not considered a good surgical candidate due to multiple comorbidities. Vaginal hysterectomy was considered but due to her long and narrow vagina, this option was deferred initially. Her only treatment option was radiation therapy and brachytherapy. She eventually underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy due to continued pelvic pain. The patient denied any prior history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Her bleeding was described as one large episode of bright red blood per rectum associated with blood clots. She denied any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or melena. The most recent colonoscopy was performed four months ago and revealed three diminutive polyps in the transverse colon with pathology confirming tubular adenoma.
Her physical examination was significant for mild left-sided abdominal tenderness but was otherwise unremarkable. Rectal examination was notable for nonbleeding hemorrhoids and no visible blood. Blood work revealed white blood cells of 14.3k/uL (normal range 4.3-10.0 k/uL) and hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL (normal range 11.8-14.8 g/dL), which is similar to the patient’s baseline. Creatinine was slightly elevated to 1.2 and blood urea nitrogen was elevated to 39. International normalized ratio was 2.0.

How are you feeling today?
Patient: Good morning, doctor. I'm feeling okay, thank you.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Can you tell me what brings you to the hospital today?
Patient: Yes, I have been experiencing some bright red blood per rectum and I'm a bit worried about it.
Doctor: I understand. Can you describe the bleeding for me?
Patient: Yes, it was one large episode of bright red blood per rectum and it was accompanied by blood clots.
Doctor: Okay, I see. And have you had any other symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or melena?
Patient: No, I haven't experienced any of those symptoms.
Doctor: Alright. Can you tell me about your medical history?
Patient: Sure. I have hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and coronary artery disease with three prior myocardial infarctions. I have also had recurrent cerebrovascular accidents and I'm on anticoagulation with warfarin. I also have gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, and I was diagnosed with endometrial cancer after radiation therapy.
Doctor: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Can you tell me about your history with endometrial cancer?
Patient: Sure. I was diagnosed with grade 1 endometrial adenoma about 15 months ago, but I was not considered a good surgical candidate due to my multiple comorbidities. Vaginal hysterectomy was considered but due to my long and narrow vagina, this option was deferred initially. My only treatment option was radiation therapy and brachytherapy. I eventually underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy due to continued pelvic pain.

"A 71-year-old African American female with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, and osteoarthritis initially presented to the emergency room with intermittent bilateral hand tingling and numbness, which was gradual in onset over months. Her symptoms were associated with seeing red spots and experiencing a burning sensation in the bottom of her feet. She was concerned because she was having difficulty picking up objects due to her hand symptoms. Her basic lab work was unremarkable, and she was provided gabapentin and magnesium oxide with close follow-up with her primary care physician. At follow-up, she complained of one to two months of unsteady gait as well as increased confusion. Her reported medications included losartan and metformin. Physical exam revealed normal pupils with reaction and accommodation (3mm diameter bilaterally), no cranial nerve deficits, normal strength throughout, and normal reflexes throughout except for diminished reflexes in the bilateral knees and ankles. She endorsed blurry vision; no ophthalmologic exam was performed, but she was able to read a name badge from one foot away. She additionally was found to have decreased vibratory and proprioception in a stocking pattern as well as a wide-based and unsteady gait.
To investigate further, tests for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), folate, B12, and rapid plasma regain (RPR) titer were ordered. Her TSH, folate, and B12 levels were within normal limits, but her RPR titer was reactive at 1:1. A subsequent reflex Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA) test was reactive. She was told to go to the hospital for further workup and treatment. Further questioning revealed that she had had two sexual partners in her life, both ex-husbands.

"Our patient is a 78-year-old male with a past medical history of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma/mycosis fungoides (on regular outpatient extracorporeal photopheresis), type II diabetes mellitus, atrial flutter on Xarelto, and sick sinus syndrome on dual-chamber pacemaker, presented to the hospital with right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The patient was a former smoker and denied any alcohol use.
In the emergency department, he was hemodynamically stable. Laboratory workup was significant for abnormally elevated liver function tests including aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) of 204/188 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 550 U/L, and total bilirubin of 2.5 mg/dL. Ultrasound of the abdomen was negative for any focal liver or gallbladder lesions. There was no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary duct dilation. Hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan was normal, and hence cholecystitis was ruled out. CT abdomen and pelvis and CT angiography of the chest were negative for acute pathology. As the patient had a pacemaker, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) could not be performed. Further laboratory evaluation for elevated liver enzymes, including viral hepatitis panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), iron panel, antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-mitochondrial antibody, alpha-1-antitrypsin antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, and ceruloplasmin was negative.
Given that the patient has a history of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, the important differential diagnosis included leukemic infiltration of the liver and adverse reaction to the prior chemotherapy. However, the patient received only a short course of the chemotherapeutic regimen mogamulizumab (due to insurance issues), and hence it was unlikely to cause this current clinical picture.

"A 24-year-old healthy woman presented with difficulty breathing and dissatisfaction with her facial appearance. She had a history of childhood trauma resulting in nasal septum deviation and external nasal deformity. Four months after a successful and uneventful septorhinoplasty, she presented to the emergency department with blunt nasal trauma resulting in a septal hematoma, which was drained successfully; the patient was discharged with no adverse sequelae.
Four months later, the patient sustained nasal trauma again, this time accompanied by clear nasal discharge, raising suspicion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. The patient was discharged after managing the nasal injury, as the CT brain showed an intact cribriform plate with no evidence of a CSF leak. Ten days later, she presented at the emergency department with dizziness and an unstable gait. She also had complaints of paresthesia for the past two months, beginning in her right hand and progressing to the right shoulder, arm and leg, associated with some difficulty in the execution of movements in the first and second finger of the right hand. Her right leg was quite stiff with difficulty in walking. On close inquiry, she gave history of pain in the right eye and double vision many months back, which had resolved spontaneously. Examination showed a positive Romberg’s and Lhermitte’s sign, with right-sided sensory impairment.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, cervical and thoracic spine demonstrated demyelinating lesions in the brain and cervical segment of the spinal cord (Figure ). Some of the lesions demonstrated enhancement on post gadolinium administration sequences, suggestive of active demyelinating diseases like MS. A lumbar puncture was performed which demonstrated the presence of oligoclonal bands in the CSF. The diagnosis of MS was confirmed by a neurologist and treatment was initiated.
The initial neurological symptoms have largely vanished with only persistent light paresthesia in the right hand. Two years later she has had no new symptoms and continues with the same medication with good tolerance.","Doctor: Hello, how are you today?

"A 64-year-old Caucasian male smoker with a horseshoe kidney with a history of open pyelolithotomy 18 years ago, presented to King Abdulaziz Medical City in mid-2020 with a report from another hospital stating that he developed gross hematuria six months prior, which was treated as a urinary tract infection. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed in that hospital, showing a horseshoe kidney with severe left hydronephrosis and enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, with the largest one located in the posterior part of the left renal artery measuring 4.7 × 3.5 × 2.6 cm. Additionally, there were multiple stones (Figures , , ). Urine culture was performed and revealed that various organisms were isolated (10-100,000 CFU/ml). Urinalysis showed a small amount of blood with a moderate presence of leukocytes and a trace protein.
At the end of 2020, the patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI showed a horseshoe kidney with chronic hydronephrosis of the left kidney and a large mass within it centrally with further satellite lesions, which all likely represent UC and associated lymphadenopathy along the para-aortic chain (Figure ). Additionally, a finding of chronic pancreatitis was noted with dilated duct and stone, for which the patient was referred to the gastroenterology department. Furthermore, a bone scan and chest CT were performed, and no significant abnormality or metastasis was found.

"A 47-year-old Caucasian male with a history of an aortic valve replacement, Factor V Leiden anomaly, migraines, and a competitive cycling hobby presented with new paracentral blind spots in the right eye following a fishing trip in Florida on August 28, 2014. The patient reported that the vision loss began during a fishing trip when he became dehydrated and had not resolved. He described three to four similar events that occurred previously following episodes of extreme physical activity, however, all resolving. On presentation in 2016, visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. No fundus abnormalities were noted. Amsler grid testing revealed two scotomas about 1 and 4 degrees superior nasal to fixation in the right eye. Spectral-domain OCT imaging also revealed several hyperreflective bands in the middle retina of the right eye (Figure ). In Figure , the hyporeflective lesions seen at the border of the fovea inferior temporal and slightly further out were consistent with his subjective superior nasal scotomas on Amsler grid testing. Spectral-domain OCT findings of PAMM were corroborated with the Chief of the Retinal Service at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary. The patient was diagnosed with findings consistent with PAMM. At that time, no treatment was given. While diagnostic measures were not taken during this patient’s first few described episodes, it was thought that the previous episodes were also consistent with PAMM, given their similar presentation on the Amsler grid testing and symptomatology.
In mid-2018, the patient presented with a left-sided visual scotoma that had developed following a recent episode of febrile gastroenteritis. Treatment started with niacinamide OTC minerals, which helped initially over 30-40 minutes. After consulting with his cardiologist, nitroglycerin was prescribed but not taken. The patient was treated with 325 mg of aspirin and 200 mg of ibuprofen every 4 hours, with minimal relief.","

Doctor: Okay. Let's take a look at your eyes. [Doctor checks patient's eyes] Your visual acuity is 20/20 in both eyes and I don't see any abnormalities. Can you tell me what you see on the Amsler grid?

Patient: I see two scotomas about 1 and 4 degrees superior nasal to fixation in my right eye.

Doctor: Okay. Let's take a look at your imaging. [Doctor shows the patient the imaging] These hyperreflective bands in the middle retina of your right eye are consistent with your scotomas on the Amsler grid.

Patient: Hmm, okay.

Doctor: The findings are consistent with a condition called PAMM.

Patient: What's that?

Doctor: It's a condition where there are lesions in the retina. The ones near the fovea inferior temporal and slightly further out are consistent with your scotomas.

Patient: I see.

Doctor: Yes, the Retinal Service at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary confirmed the diagnosis. At that time, no treatment was given, but we can start now if you'd like.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: For your recent episode, you started treatment with niacinamide OTC minerals, correct?

Patient: Yes, it helped initially over 30-40 minutes.

Doctor: And after consulting with your cardiologist, nitroglycerin was prescribed but not taken. You were treated with 325 mg of aspirin and 200 mg of ibuprofen every 4 hours, with minimal relief.

Patient: That's correct.

Doctor: Alright. I'll prescribe a different medication for you to try and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to see how you're doing.

Patient: Okay, doctor. Thank you.

"The patient was a 68-year-old female with a G3P2 (G, gravidity; P, parity) pregnancy history who had undergone a pancreatoduodenectomy of the pancreas to remove a tumor (adenocarcinoma) of the duodenal papillae at our hospital five years ago. She underwent computed tomography (CT) during the postoperative follow-up and was suspected of having an ovarian tumor (Figure ); thus, she visited our Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Transvaginal ultrasound showed a mass with abundant internal blood flow in the bladder mucosa (Figure ). Although the patient had no urinary tract symptoms, an examination by a urologist was deemed necessary. Accordingly, the patient was referred to the Department of Urology, and urinalysis and urine cytology were performed because early-stage bladder cancer was suspected. Urinalysis showed no hematuria, but urine cytology showed dysmorphic cells that were indicative of a tumor. Cystoscopy revealed a stalked papillary tumor at the apex of the posterior wall of the bladder. Transurethral resection of bladder tumor was performed the following month. A 2-cm papillary tumor was found at the apex of the bladder (Figure ), and the lesion was resected, followed by intravesical chemotherapy administration. The pathological diagnosis revealed that the removed mass was a non-muscle-invasive bladder tumor (transitional cell carcinoma, stage 0a). At the three-month postoperative follow-up, no recurrence was noted. Postoperative CT examination has not yet been performed.","Doctor: Good morning, what brings you here today?
Patient: Good morning, doctor. I came here for a follow-up on my bladder cancer.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me a bit more about your medical history?
Patient: Sure. I had a pancreatoduodenectomy five years ago to remove a tumor in my pancreas. And then I was suspected of having an ovarian tumor, so I visited the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology.
Doctor: Hmm, I see. And what happened then?
Patient: They performed a Transvaginal ultrasound and found a mass in my bladder mucosa.
Doctor: I see. And did you have any urinary tract symptoms?
Patient: No, I didn't have any symptoms.
Doctor: Okay, I understand. So, you were referred to the Department of Urology for an examination, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: And what was the result of the urinalysis and urine cytology?
Patient: The urinalysis showed no hematuria, but the urine cytology showed dysmorphic cells that were indicative of a tumor.
Doctor: I see. And then, what kind of examination was performed?
Patient: They performed a cystoscopy and found a stalked papillary tumor at the apex of the posterior wall of the bladder.
Doctor: I see. And then what was done next?
Patient: They performed a Transurethral resection of bladder tumor the following month.
Doctor: And what did the pathological diagnosis reveal?
Patient: The removed mass was a non-muscle-invasive bladder tumor, a transitional cell carcinoma, stage 0a.
Doctor: I see. And how is your condition now?
Patient: At the three-month postoperative follow-up, no recurrence was noted.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Have you had a postoperative CT examination yet?
Patient: No, I haven't had it yet.
Doctor: Okay, I would recommend you to have a postoperative CT examination as soon as possible. And also, you need to have regular follow-ups to make sure there's no recurrence.
Patient: Okay, I understand.

"A 59-year-old female, current smoker with 20 pack-years history, with a past medical history only significant for hypertension, gradually developed anorexia, nausea, fatigue, and weight loss. She initially presented to the emergency department with left flank pain and on CT scan of the abdomen was found to have diffuse osteosclerotic lesions in visualized bones. She was then followed up in primary care clinic where workup for an occult malignancy was initiated. There was no palpable mass or axillary adenopathy on breast examination. She had multiple mammograms in the past, some of which had shown suspicious architecture, which was followed up with multiple breast ultrasounds that had revealed benign findings. Mammogram was repeated and was reported benign with BI-RADS 2. Nuclear bone scan was unremarkable. CT chest revealed no pulmonary lesions but there were small mediastinal, submental, and axillary lymphadenopathy and several subcutaneous lesions on the back (one of which was excised and showed inclusion epidermal cyst). Multiple myeloma workup was negative.
While the workup was ongoing, the patient started to experience lower back pain associated with weakness of lower extremities, numbness, tingling, and balance issues. She developed constipation as well as urinary incontinence. MRI of the brain and spine redemonstrated similar bony lesions in vertebrae, and also revealed abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement in the brainstem extending along the entire spinal cord (Figure ).

"A 33-year-old female with no prior medical comorbidities, who recently gave birth to a healthy girl child four months ago, was brought to the emergency department with sudden onset weakness of both upper and lower limbs that started four days prior and rapidly progressed to a state of quadriplegia. She was conscious and obeyed simple commands with eyes and mouth; however, she had severe dysarthria. She had bilateral facial palsy and bulbar palsy. She had flaccid, hyporeflexic, pure motor quadriplegia with limbs showing only a subtle withdrawal flicker to pain. MRI of the brain revealed hyperintensity in the central pons in diffusion-weighted images (Figure ), T2-weighted images (Figure ), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images (Figure ) without abnormal contrast enhancement (Figure ), consistent with central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) (Figure ).
The biochemical analysis showed hypernatremia while the remaining electrolytes were normal. The rest of the blood workup was unremarkable. Relatives denied an antecedent history of hyponatremia with rapid correction. The patient was started on sodium correction and was given five days intravenous (IV) pulse methylprednisolone 1 g/day to stabilize the blood-brain barrier. The patient recovered significantly to normal power. She was then considered to have idiopathic hypernatremic osmotic demyelination and was discharged with a modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) of 0.
One year later, she presented to the neurology department with a one-week history of generalized fatigue, diffuse myalgias, and three days history of rapidly progressive weakness of all four limbs making her wheelchair-bound one day before the presentation. Her initial vital signs were unremarkable. She was noted to have a pure motor flaccid symmetric quadriparesis with proximal more than distal weakness and generalized hyporeflexia. Clinical examination of other systems was normal. Nerve conduction","
Doctor: Hi, how can I help you today?

Patient: Hi, I was brought to the emergency department recently with sudden weakness in my limbs.

Doctor: Okay, I see. Can you tell me a bit more about your symptoms?

Patient: Yes, I had weakness in both my upper and lower limbs and it started four days ago. It quickly got worse and I ended up with quadriplegia.

Doctor: Hmm, did you have any other symptoms besides weakness in your limbs?

Patient: Yes, I had severe dysarthria and bulbar palsy. I also had bilateral facial palsy.

Doctor: I see. And were you conscious during this time?

Patient: Yes, I was conscious and I could obey simple commands with my eyes and mouth.

Doctor: Okay. We did some tests on you and the results showed that you had central pontine myelinolysis.

Patient: Hmm, what is that?

Doctor: Central pontine myelinolysis is a condition where there is damage to the central pons in the brain. It can cause symptoms like weakness in the limbs and bulbar palsy.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: And the MRI showed hyperintensity in the central pons in diffusion-weighted images, T2-weighted images, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images.

Patient: Hmm, okay.

Doctor: And the biochemical analysis showed that you had hypernatremia. But the rest of your electrolytes were normal.

Patient: Okay.

Laboratory assessment is in Table . The patient was quickly weaned to room air, with SpO2 of 94-98%; hence, only supportive care was provided for COVID-19. On Day 1, the patient was found to have a right foot wound infection and was started on intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. On Day 2, the patient was found to be hypoxic, put on 5 L per minute of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, and started on dexamethasone and remdesivir. Because of end-stage renal disease, the patient did not qualify for baricitinib. On Day 4, the patient required 10 L per minute of supplemental oxygen via high-flow nasal cannula, which he needed until Day 12, when we could start weaning down the supplemental oxygen over the next 3-4 days until Day 15 to room air. On Day 17, the patient was put back on 2 L per minute of supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula which quickly escalated to 15 L on a nonrebreather mask within 2-3 hours, requiring the patient to get transferred to the intensive care unit on Day 18. At this time, he was put on bilevel positive airway pressure (Bi","Doctor: Good morning. My name is Dr. Smith. How are you feeling today?

"A 23-year-old Caucasian male with a history of exercise-induced asthma presented to the emergency department complaining of left-sided chest pain which started two days after receiving the second dose of the mRNA-1273 Moderna vaccine. The patient described the pain as sharp, intermittent with radiation to the left upper back and left arm with 10/10 severity and worsening with deep inspiration. Fever and chills were also present. The patient did not report any recent history of tick bites, upper respiratory symptoms, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND), orthopnea, arthralgias or rashes.
On physical examination the patient was in no distress, with normal vital signs, normal S1/S2 heart sounds without any murmurs, rubs, or gallops and no jugular vein distention (JVD). There was no palpable tenderness of the chest wall. The lungs were clear to auscultation. There was no pitting edema in the lower extremities.
Diagnostic testing revealed elevated troponin T of 475ng/L (<22ng/L) which trended upward reaching a peak of 910ng/L (<22ng/L). Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed right axis deviation with left posterior fascicular block without any ST elevations as well as premature atrial contractions (PACs) in trigeminy (Figure ). A bedside ultrasound showed trace pericardial effusion. CT angiography (CTA) of the chest was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE).

"A 35-year-old male presented with a foreign body in his left ear caused by a trauma to the left parietal area by a fishhook. The patient was in a boat on a fishing trip when the fishhook accidentally pierced his upper neck behind the left auricle and pierced the auricle of the left ear. On examination, the patient was conscious and oriented and no bleeding, swelling, hematoma or bruises were noticed. Vital measurements and systemic review revealed normal findings. The patient received an intramuscular injection of 0.5 mL tetanus toxoid adsorbed vaccine and was referred for surgical assessment and foreign body removal. Under local anesthesia, the triple needle fishhook was removed and cut by a bone nipper from left pinna and post-auricular area (Figure ). The lacerated wound was stitched by 05 Ethilon suture, left mastoid dressing was applied and the patient was discharged after prescribing per-oral cefuroxime and diclofenac for five days.
Two weeks later, the patient returned to the hospital for follow-up. On examination, left pinna and post-auricular area were normal. However, a small, non-tender, firm 2 x 2 mm subcutaneous swelling was noticed below the ear lobule. Amoxicillin/clavulanate and diclofenac sodium were prescribed, and the patient was discharged.
In the follow-up visit two months after the injury, the patient was assessed for a localized small, non-tender, 2 x 2 mm parotid swelling at the angle of mandible on the left side. The swelling appeared after the removal of the foreign body two months ago and did not get resolved. Ultrasound (US) of the neck showed a linear hypoechoic focus in the superficial parotid gland extending to the subcutaneous tissue (Figure ). The presence of scar or granulation tissue was suspected and no focal mass lesions were detected. In addition, a few oval-shaped","Doctor: Good morning, what brings you here today?

"An 18-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with right hip pain for two weeks. Examination revealed pain and mild to moderate tenderness in the right hip joint. The range of motion was decreased, and trying to initiate movement caused severe pain to the extent that the patient could not walk for gait assessment. Past history revealed similar but less severe episodes for the last four years. There was no history of fever, skin rash, or acne. His inflammatory laboratory investigations, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), were within the normal limits. X-rays of the pelvis and right thigh were unremarkable except for a small lucency in the right greater trochanteric region (Figure ).
Subsequently, an MRI of the right thigh showed trochanteric bursa effusion and right hip joint synovitis (Figures , ).
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol were started for the management, and the patient showed excellent improvement for the first three months.
He remained well for four months, after which he developed swelling of the right sternoclavicular joint. X-ray of the joint and laboratory investigations were found to be normal (Figure ).
Due to the previous history of the right hip joint, the lesion was investigated further with MRI (Figures , , ).
A patchy area of hyperintensity on T2 and hypointensity on T1 images close to the sternoclavicular junction was observed. On post-contrast images, there was a mild accentuated heterogeneous enhancement. Traces of fluid was also noted in the joint space, and marrow edema was seen along the articular margin and body of the sternum. MRI also showed subcutaneous edema and changes related to cellulitis in the overlying soft tissues. Clinical history and imaging data were suggestive of SAPHO syndrome.

"A previously healthy 49-year-old female with a past medical history of well-controlled hypertension and body mass index (BMI) of 30.37 kg/m2 presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, abdominal pain, hematemesis, and hypotension. According to family, the patient complained of abdominal pain earlier that morning and was later found at home minimally responsive and recurrently vomiting blood.
In the emergency department, the patient’s vitals included a blood pressure of 94/50 mmHg, a temperature of 87.1 Fahrenheit, and a respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute. The patient was intubated for airway protection. She received 5L of fluid as well as one unit of packed red blood cells for suspected large fluid volume loss. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and was remarkable for a Mallory-Weiss tear with portohypertensive gastropathy. This was thought to be caused by the repeated vomiting reported by her family. CT scan showed peripancreatic edema and fat stranding, consistent with acute pancreatitis (Figure ). A repeat CT scan was done to evaluate the progression of her pancreatitis, which showed worsening pancreatitis with developing ascites. Labs were remarkable for a glucose up to 955 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c) of 13.7%, and a triglyceride level up to 1608 mg/dL (Table ). The patient was then placed on an insulin drip for her significantly elevated blood glucose. After her glucose normalized, she was continued on an insulin drip until her triglycerides dropped below 500 mg/dL. The patient was then downgraded to the general medical floor and discharged after being able to tolerate a regular diet without significant pain or discomfort.","

"A 66-year-old male with back pain and cough for two weeks was admitted to the First Hospital of Jiaxing on 8 August 2019. A thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan revealed that the malignant tumor on the left upper lobe was complicated by distal obstructive inflammation, the enlargement of the left hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, and the multiple bone metastases on 25 August 2019 (Fig. A). Immunohistochemical (IHC) results of the posterior iliac bone marrow biopsy specimen showed the positive expression of CD3, CD20, CD34, CD235a, and NPO, and the negative CD61 expression. IHC results of an endoscopic biopsy specimen of the bronchial mucosa on the upper left lobe showed the positive expression of TTF1, CK7, NapsinA, Ki67, CK, and EMA, and the negative expression of CK5/6, P40, CgA, Syn, and CD45 on 6 September 2019. Histopathologic observations showed infiltration of atypia cells in mucosal and fibrous tissues. The detection tools of pathology and cytology included automatic IHC staining (BenchMark XT, Roche, The United States), digital slice scanner, image analysis software (Pannoramic 250, 3DHistech, Hungary), and microscope (Eclipse Ci-S, Nikon, Japan). Finally, the patient was diagnosed with stage IVb lung adenocarcinoma combing with bone metastases.
